# Rate limiter System Design

## 1. Functional requirements:

-   Limit the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specific time window.
-   Allow dynamic configuration of rate limits for different APIs or clients.
-   Design the rate limiter to be distributed, allowing scalability across multiple servers.

## 2. Non-functional Requirements:
-   The system should handle a large number of requests and scale horizontally as the load increases.
-   Requests should be processed with minimal latency, and rate limiting decisions should be made quickly.
-   The system should be resilient to failures, ensuring continued functionality even if some components fail.

## 3. Back of the envelope estimations:













3. Components and Architecture:
a. Token Bucket Algorithm:
Use the Token Bucket algorithm for rate limiting. Clients consume tokens, and the bucket is refilled at a predefined rate.
b. Redis:
Utilize a distributed data store like Redis to store and manage the state of the token bucket across multiple servers.
c. API Server Middleware:
Integrate the rate limiter as middleware in the API servers. Before processing a request, check if the client has enough tokens.
d. Configuration Service:
Implement a configuration service for dynamic rate limit adjustments. API servers can query this service to get the latest rate limits.
e. Monitoring and Logging:
Integrate a monitoring and logging system to track usage patterns, identify potential abuses, and monitor the health of the rate limiter.
f. Distributed Locks:
Use distributed locks (e.g., Redis distributed locks) to ensure atomicity when updating the token bucket state.
4. Workflow:
Client Request:

When a client makes a request, the rate limiter checks if there are enough tokens in the bucket.
Token Consumption:

If tokens are available, consume them, and process the request.
Rate Limit Exceeded:

If tokens are not available, reject the request or delay its processing.
Token Refill:

Refill the token bucket at a constant rate, ensuring a steady supply of tokens.
5. Scalability:
Sharding:

Shard the rate limiter across multiple instances to distribute the load.
Load Balancing:

Implement load balancing to evenly distribute requests among rate limiter instances.
6. Persistence:
Redis Persistence:
Ensure data persistence in Redis to recover the token bucket state in case of failures.
7. Security Considerations:
Authentication:

Ensure that rate limiting is applied per authenticated client.
Secure Configuration:

Securely manage and store rate limit configurations.
8. Monitoring and Analytics:
Metrics Collection:

Collect metrics on rate-limiting decisions, token consumption, and system health.
Analytics Dashboard:

Implement an analytics dashboard for administrators to monitor usage patterns.
9. Testing:
Unit Testing:

Implement thorough unit tests for the rate limiter components.
Integration Testing:

Conduct integration testing to ensure all components work seamlessly.
10. Documentation:
API Documentation:

Document the API for developers and administrators.
Deployment Guide:

Provide a deployment guide for system administrators.
