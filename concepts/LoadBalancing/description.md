# Comprehensive Guide to Load Balancers

## 1. Historical Reasoning for Load Balancers

In the early days of the internet, websites were hosted on single servers. As traffic increased, these single servers often became overwhelmed, leading to slow response times, crashes, and poor user experiences. To address these issues, organizations started using multiple servers to handle traffic. However, distributing traffic across these servers required a mechanism to ensure that each request was handled efficiently, leading to the development of load balancers.

Initially, load balancing was a simple round-robin approach implemented at the DNS level. However, as websites grew more complex and required more sophisticated handling of traffic, load balancers evolved to become more advanced, capable of performing `health checks`, `SSL termination`, `session persistence`, and more.

## 2. Types of Load Balancers

Load balancers can be classified based on several criteria, such as where they operate in the network stack (OSI model), how they distribute traffic, and the types of deployments they support.

### 2.1 Based on OSI Model Layers

-   **Layer 4 Load Balancers (Transport Layer)**

    -   Operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
    -   Distribute traffic based on data from network and transport layer protocols, such as IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports.
    -   They are faster as they do not look into the content of the traffic, just the `source` and `destination` IP addresses.
    -   Advantages : `Efficient`, `Low Latency`, `High Throughput`
    -   Examples:
        -   AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)
        -   NGINX - in Layer 4 mode
        -   HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) - in Layer 4 mode
        -   F5 BIG-IP LTM (Local Traffic Manager) - in Layer 4 mode
        -   Microsoft Azure Load Balance - in Layer 4 mode
        -   Citrix ADC (Application Delivery Controller), formally known as NetScaler - in Layer 4 mode
        -   Kemp LoadMaster - in Layer 4 mode

-   **Layer 7 Load Balancers (Application Layer)**
    -   Operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
    -   Make routing decisions based on the content of the application data, such as HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, etc.
    -   They can perform more advanced routing decisions and optimizations.
    -   Advantages : `Content-Based Routing`, `SSL Termination`, `Session Persistence`
    -   Examples:
        -   AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
        -   NGINX - in Layer 7 mode
        -   HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) - in Layer 7 mode
        -   F5 BIG-IP LTM (Local Traffic Manager) - in Layer 7 mode
        -   Citrix ADC (Application Delivery Controller), formally known as NetScaler - in Layer 7 mode
        -   Kemp LoadMaster - in Layer 7 mode

### 2.2 Based on Traffic Distribution Algorithms

-   **Round Robin**

    -   Distributes requests sequentially across a pool of servers.
    -   Simple and effective for environments where servers have similar capacity and performance.

-   **Weighted Round Robin**

    -   Similar to round robin but assigns a weight to each server based on capacity or other factors.
    -   Servers with higher weights receive more requests.

-   **Least Connections**

    -   Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
    -   Ideal for environments where connections have varying lengths and server load varies significantly.

-   **IP Hash**

    -   Uses a hash of the client’s IP address to assign the client to a specific server.
    -   Ensures that requests from the same client go to the same server, which can be important for session persistence.

-   **Random**

    -   Randomly selects a server for each request.
    -   Can be useful in simple scenarios but may lead to imbalances in server load.

-   **Least Response Time**

    -   Directs traffic to the server with the lowest response time.
    -   Helps in distributing traffic to the most responsive servers.

-   **Least Bandwidth**
    -   Directs traffic to the server currently serving the least amount of traffic by bandwidth.

### 2.3 Based on Deployment Models

-   **Hardware Load Balancers**

    -   Dedicated physical devices specifically designed to handle high volumes of network traffic.
    -   Common in enterprise environments requiring high throughput and advanced features.
    -   Offer robust performance but can be expensive and less flexible than software-based solutions.
    -   Examples: `F5 Networks BIG-IP`, `Citrix ADC (Application Delivery Controller)`, `Kemp LoadMaster`.

-   **Software Load Balancers**

    -   Software-based solutions that can be deployed on standard servers or virtual machines.
    -   Common in cloud environments and organizations that require flexibility and scalability.
    -   Offer greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness.
    -   Examples:`NGINX`, `HAProxy (High Availability Proxy)`, `Apache Traffic Server`.

-   **Cloud Load Balancers**
    -   Load balancers provided as a service by cloud providers.
    -   Highly scalable and managed by the cloud provider, reducing the need for operational overhead.
    -   Optimal for cloud-native applications and hybrid cloud environments.
    -   Examples: `AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)`, `Google Cloud Load Balancing`, `Azure Load Balancer`.

### 2.4 Based on Session Persistence:

-   **Sticky Sessions (Session Persistence)**:

    -   Ensures that requests from a particular client are always routed to the same server.
    -   This is essential for applications that store session data on local servers.
    -   Can be implemented using `cookies`, `IP hash`, or other techniques.

-   **Non-Persistent Sessions**:
    -   No effort is made to route requests from the same client to the same server.
    -   This approach is stateless and scalable.
    -   Often used in stateless applications where session data is stored centrally (e.g., in a database or distributed cache).

### 2.5 Based on Redundancy and High Availability:

-   **Active-Passive Load Balancers**:

    -   In this setup, one load balancer is active while another is passive (standby).
    -   The passive load balancer takes over if the active one fails.
    -   Provides high availability with a failover mechanism.
    -   Suitable for environments where downtime is unacceptable.

-   **Active-Active Load Balancers**:
    -   Both load balancers are active and share the load.
    -   If one fails, the other continues to operate without disruption.
    -   Provides maximum availability and load distribution.
    -   Suitable for environments requiring high availability and scalability.

### 2.6 Based on Security Features:

-   **SSL/TLS Offloading**:

    -   Load balancers can terminate SSL/TLS connections, decrypting incoming traffic and forwarding it to backend servers in plain text.
    -   Reduces the processing load on backend servers and simplifies certificate management.

-   **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
    -   Some load balancers include WAF capabilities to protect against common web application security threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks.
    -   Suitable for applications requiring both load balancing and enhanced security.

## 4. Technical Information Related to Load Balancers

### 4.1 Health Checks

-   Load balancers perform health checks on backend servers to ensure they are available and can handle requests.
-   If a server fails a health check, the load balancer will stop directing traffic to that server until it recovers.

### 4.2 SSL/TLS Termination

-   SSL termination involves decrypting incoming SSL traffic at the load balancer level, which then forwards the unencrypted traffic to the backend servers.
-   This reduces the processing load on backend servers and simplifies SSL certificate management.

### 4.3 Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)

-   Load balancers can be configured to direct all requests from a particular user to the same backend server.
-   This is important for applications that store session state locally on the server.

### 4.4 Content-Based Routing

-   Layer 7 load balancers can inspect the content of incoming requests and route them to different backend servers based on rules.

-   host based routing :

    -   www.example.com -> server1
    -   api.example.com -> server2

-   path based routing :

    -   /api -> server1
    -   /app -> server2

-   header based routing :

    -   X-Forwarded-For: <IP> -> server1
    -   X-Forwarded-For: <IP> -> server2

-   cookie based routing :

    -   session=1 -> server1
    -   session=2 -> server2

-   query parameter based routing :

    -   ?user=1 -> server1
    -   ?user=2 -> server2

-   method based routing :

    -   GET -> server1
    -   POST -> server2

-   Other factors like `user-agent`, `content-type`, etc., can also be used for routing decisions.

### 4.5 Anycast Load Balancing

-   Anycast routing allows multiple servers to share the same IP address.
-   The network automatically routes requests to the nearest server, which is particularly useful for global load balancing.
